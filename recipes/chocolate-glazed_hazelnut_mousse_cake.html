    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This wonderfully rich, silky dessert is an ideal choice when you're entertaining a group of friends. Featuring a hazelnut shortbread crust that provides a crisp based for the moist, airy mousse, it is simple to prepare, can be made ahead of time, and does not require any last-minute fussing. Nutella -- beloved by Europeans (and by more Americans than admit to it) -- acts as a stealth ingredient that both echoes and enhances the marriage of the crust and the mousse. So whether you find yourself with or without a Valentine this year, it will be love at first bite. -- Lawrence Karol </p>
